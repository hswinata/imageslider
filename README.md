The Image Slider project represents one of my earliest endeavors in web development during my journey through a coding bootcamp. This project aimed to create a simple yet functional image slider, showcasing my initial skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

While the project may appear raw and simplistic, it serves as a testament to my progression and growth as a developer. Since completing this project, I have continued to enhance my skills and tackle more complex projects.

## Features

   - The project offers a straightforward image slider that cycles through a series of images.
2. Navigation Buttons:

3. Indicator Dots:
   - Indicator dots at the bottom allow users to see which image is currently displayed and navigate directly to specific images.

## Technologies

   - HTML was used for structuring the web page and creating the foundation for content.
2. CSS:
   - CSS was employed to style the image slider and create a visually appealing design.
3. JavaScript:
   - JavaScript was used to implement the image slider's functionality, including image transitions and indicator dot navigation.
